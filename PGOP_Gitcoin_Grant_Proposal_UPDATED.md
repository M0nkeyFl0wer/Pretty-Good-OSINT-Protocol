# Pretty Good OSINT Protocol (PGOP)
**Gitcoin Grant Proposal (Updated)**

### TL;DR
**‚ÄúNow not only the bad guys have these tools.‚Äù**  
PGOP is an open-source intelligence platform that democratizes access to web and blockchain investigative tooling for journalists, public interest researchers, and civic technologists. It now includes AI-powered automation via OpenAI, Claude, and other language model APIs to help automate investigation workflows, summarize findings, and suggest next steps.

---

### Project Description
PGOP (Pretty Good OSINT Protocol) is a modular, open-source investigation toolkit with both a simple UI (‚ÄúHave I Been Rekt‚Äù) and advanced CLI tools. It allows users to:

- Run deep OSINT scans using SpiderFoot + enhanced modules
- Investigate wallets, smart contracts, and DAOs
- Use AI assistants (OpenAI, Claude, etc.) to summarize findings, automate scanning workflows, and classify targets
- Store and timestamp findings immutably on Orbit Chain or Base
- Publish findings for journalism, research, or accountability
- Protect sensitive data using zero-knowledge proofs via Holonym

---

### Use Cases
- Civic journalism (e.g. tracing political donors, online disinfo ops)
- Web3 risk auditing (wallet tracing, DAO ops, on-chain forensics)
- Open source human rights investigations
- Smart contract due diligence
- Blockchain leak & fraud analysis
- Academic/public-interest research and FOIA companions

---

### Why Now?
Governments and private intelligence firms have access to expensive, closed systems. Threat actors use similar tooling freely. Most ethical orgs, researchers, and citizens can‚Äôt compete or verify what they uncover.

PGOP levels the playing field‚Äî**giving the public access to what the powerful already have.**

### Features

| Area | Capability |
|------|------------|
| OSINT Engine | Modular search of social, domain, publication, and image metadata |
| AI Assistant | Use GPT, Claude, or open LLMs to summarize data, suggest next steps, and build investigation workflows |
| Multimedia | Facial similarity (PimEyes), GPS data (ExifTool), visual landmark analysis |
| Blockchain Forensics | Wallet tracking, smart contract scanning, DAO mapping |
| Immutable Storage | Publish findings via IPFS + Orbit/Base |
| Privacy Layer | zkProof redaction and Holonym integration |
| Crypto Payments | Users can pay for WHOIS, Hunter, etc. with crypto |
| GUI + CLI | Streamlit UI + advanced command line tooling |

**Figma onboarding slides include:**
1. Welcome Modal ‚Äì What PGOP is, how it works
2. Data Types Explainer ‚Äì Wallets, domains, people, contracts
3. API Key Setup Wizard ‚Äì Input keys + live status check
4. AI Assistant Introduction ‚Äì Pick your LLM (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
5. Privacy Commitment Slide ‚Äì ZK privacy, local-only mode
6. First Scan Flow ‚Äì Real example walkthrough

### Impact
PGOP is already useful in offline mode, but with community funding we can:

- Polish UI/UX for non-technical users
- Add prompt-to-scan and AI-assisted workflows
- Launch onboarding + privacy tools
- Support journalists, DAOs, and NGOs with limited resources
- Add face matching, Telegram/Discord scanning, smart contract analysis

### Roadmap & Milestones

| Milestone | Deliverable |
|----------|-------------|
| ‚úÖ MVP v0.1 | Modular OSINT + blockchain scan engine, CLI, Docker, IPFS export |
| üöß Grant Phase | Add onboarding UI, ZK redaction, AI assistants, smart contract scanning |
| ‚úÖ Hugging Face Demo | Hosted Streamlit version for live testing |
| üîú PGOP Cloud | Optional hosted deployment with API quotas |
| üöÄ v1.0 Launch | Full UI/CLI parity, multi-language, plug-in SDK, prompt-to-scan |

---

### Challenges & Risks

| Area | Challenge |
|------|-----------|
| Cost | APIs like WHOISXML, PimEyes, Bitquery, and LLMs can be expensive long-term |
| Data Privacy | Balancing powerful tools with ethical redaction (zkProofs help) |
| Abuse Prevention | Preventing misuse by bad actors (rate-limiting, local-only mode) |
| UI Complexity | Need to bridge CLI power with GUI simplicity |
| Funding | Ongoing open-source support for non-VC tools is difficult |

---

### Competitive Landscape

| Project | Comparison |
|---------|------------|
| SpiderFoot | Used as a base, but not UI-friendly, lacks blockchain tooling |
| Maltego | Powerful, but expensive and proprietary |
| PimEyes / Skopenow | Facial search, but unethical access and no auditing tools |
| TRM Labs / Chainalysis | Excellent blockchain forensics, but closed to public |
| Arkham | Tokenized intelligence market, but not open source or ethics-first |

**PGOP is the only open, modular, privacy-respecting platform that combines OSINT, blockchain, and AI.**
